# f1-2021-titlefight
This project is an analysis of the championship title fight between Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton during the Formula One 2021 season.

# data
Data was webscraped from the results archive of the [official Formula One website](https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html) following [this guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/formula-one-extracting-and-analysing-historical-results-19c950cda1d1). I extracted data on race results, sprint race results, qualifying results, starting grid order, and fastest laps using [this python script](f1-2021-webscrape.py).
